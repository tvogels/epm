  pagetitle: About EPM
  heading: The Company
  lead: |
    EPM GmbH ("Entwicklung, Produktion und Management") is a consulting firm specializing in advising manufacturing companies.  For this reason, the principles of Lean Management and Lean Production serve as guidelines for all consultation steps.
  body: |
    <p>At the center of all activities lies the optimization of organizational and production-related processes, with the goal of sustained improvement in business performance.  Our experts are available for fast troubleshooting should you run into acute problems, for instance, related to quality.</p>
    <p>The starting point for all optimization measures is the definition, analysis and monitoring of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In order to guarantee business-wide data consistency and target-audience-specific reporting, an EPM subsidiary has developed a Performance-Monitoring System that can be flexibly adjusted to a client’s individual needs.</p>
    <p>The transparency gained concerning important indicators serves as a basis for the identification of optimization potential and the tracking of actions that have been introduced. These actions can extend to all production sectors including procurement, logisitics, production and quality. </p>
    <p>In order to implement the approved optimization measures and to quickly achieve the desired goals, EMP recommends a team consisting of the client’s employees and EPM specialists. </p>
    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <p>The consultants at EPM have excellent know-how in a wide range of sectors and many years of experience in industry.  The EPM team not only excels in the development of practical concepts, but also in their strong ability to realize these ideas. In line with the motto “Getting it done”, EPM places a particular focus on the lasting implementation of recommended actions.</p>
    <h2>The Clients</h2>
    <p>The clientele of EMP includes international companies from varied sectors (automotive, metal and plastic processing, pharmaceutical, hygiene and more), though the automotive industry forms the focus of the consulting activities.</p>
    <p>Along with many performance-optimization projects, the EPM also has many years of experience in the successful implementation of remediation projects.</p>
