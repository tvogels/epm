  pagetitle: About EPM
  heading: The Company
  lead: |
    EPM GmbH ("Entwicklung, Produktion und Management" - Development, Production and Management) is a consulting firm specializing in production facilities.  For this reason, the principles of Lean Management and Lean Production serve as guidelines for all consultation steps.
  body: |
    <p>Optimization of organizational and production-related processes is at the center of all activities with the goal of sustained improvement in business performance.  Our experts are available for fast troubleshooting should you run into acute problems for instance, related to quality.</p>
    <p>The starting point for all optimization measures is the definition, analysis and monitoring of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In order to guarantee business-wide data consistency and target-audience-specific reporting, an EPM subsidiary has developed a Performance-Monitoring System that can be flexibly adjusted to a client’s individual needs.</p>
    <p>The transparency concerning important figures achieved thereby serves as a basis for the identification of optimization potential and the tracking of any introduced actions. These actions can extend to all production sectors including purchasing, logisitics, production and quality. </p>
    <p>In order to implement the approved optimization measures and to quickly achieve the desired goals, EMP recommends a team consisting of the client’s employees and EPM specialists. </p>
    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <p>The consultants at EPM have excellent know-how in a wide range of sectors and many years of experience in industry.  The EPM team not only excels in the development practical concepts, but also in their strong ability to realize these ideas. In line with the motto “Getting it done”, EPM places a particular focus on the lasting implementation of suggested actions.</p>
    <h2>The Clients</h2>
    <p>The clientele of EMP includes international companies from varied sectors (automotive, metal and plastic processing, pharmaceutical, hygienics and more), though the automotive industry forms the focus of the consulting activities.</p>
    <p>Along with many performance-optimization projects, the EPM also has many years of experience implementing remediation projects.</p>
